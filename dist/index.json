Our security team will designate a Response Manager in charge of a particular report based on expertise and availability.  They will acknowledge receipt of the report in a quick response to the researcher.  The Response Manager will evaluate the vulnerability and assign an initial OWASP Severity estimate. They may optionally also contact the researcher using a secure private channel for more information. Based on the vulnerability’s potential OWASP Severity additional security team members will be alerted for additional review and to develop a patch.  Response Manager designates a private git branch for the patch + proposed OWASP score Reviewed by security team Response Manager drafts vulnerability announcement for the community  Severity - Systems impacted - Solutions / patches  Security team discusses a release target + date for the announcement + patch Response Manager communicates with the researcher who submitted the vulnerability:  Proposed patch + release date Whether the researcher would like public credit for reporting the bug (anonymous reporting is also supported) Reporter’s bounty distribution address  The security team will make a best effort to complete the above process within 90 days.  Community notifications and patches  For High or Critical Severity issues, the security team will notify the Filecoin community that a security release is imminent. Notifications can include Filecoin Community Slack announcements, tweets, emails to ecosystem collaborators.  24 hours following this notification, the fixes are applied publicly and new releases are issued.  Medium to High Severity issues may result in a minor release including the patch. Low severity issues can be addressed in the next regular release.
