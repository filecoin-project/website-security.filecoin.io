ðŸš€ ***Exciting News! Our Bug Bounty Program is Getting a Makeover!*** ðŸš€

We are thrilled to announce that we are revamping our bug bounty program and moving it over to Immunefi, a leading platform for decentralized finance security. This transition represents a significant upgrade in our commitment to security and transparency.

***Please note that vulnerabilities reported via security@filecoin.org will no longer be eligible for monetary rewards. We encourage you to use the Immunefi platform for all future submissions to qualify for rewards.***

Thank you for your continued support and dedication to improving our security posture.
