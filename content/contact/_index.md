#### Rewards

Reported security vulnerabilities will be eligible for a Bug Bounty based on Severity, calculated based on its Impact and Likelihood using the [OWASP Risk Rating model](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

The following point ranges will be assigned based on Severity:

  - Critical: up to 25,000 points
  - High: up to 15,000 points
  - Medium: up to 10,000 points
  - Low: up to 2,000 points
  - Note: up to 500 points

Where currently 1 point = 1 USD (payable in USD, DAI or FIL).

Higher rewards will also be paid to reported vulnerabilities that offer quality written descriptions, test code, scripts and detailed instructions, and well-documented fixes.

Evaluation of the significance of the vulnerability and specific bounty amount assigned is at the sole discretion of the Filecoin Security Team, which consists of core developers and contributors.


> <small>NOTE: Reporters are responsible for all taxes and all awards subject to applicable law.</small>

> <small>We are also not able to pay bounty awards to individuals from a country against which the U.S. has trade restrictions or export sanctions.</small>


#### Scope

In scope for our Bug Bounty program are vulnerabilities in the core protocol and protocol implementations that have been security audited:

  - lotus
  - go-fil-markets
  - spec-actors
  - rust-fil-proofs

<small>* Implementations undergoing active development that have not yet been security audited are currently not in scope.</small>

Visit the <a href="https://spec.filecoin.io/#intro__implementations-status" target="_blank">Filecoin Spec: Implementation Status</a> for more information about these projects and their audits.


#### Out-of-Scope

 - Filecoin websites and Filecoin infrastructure in general are not part of the bug bounty program.

 - Third-party services and websites that show information about the Filecoin network (block explorers, stats dashboards, price indicators, miner leaderboards, etc.) are also out of scope.

 - Vulnerabilities previously submitted by another person are not eligible for bug bounty rewards.

 - Public disclosure of a vulnerability makes it ineligible for a bug bounty.

 - Filecoinâ€™s core development team, employees of Protocol Labs, the Filecoin Foundation and others paid by these organizations to work on the Filecoin project, indirectly or directly, are not eligible for bug bounty rewards.
