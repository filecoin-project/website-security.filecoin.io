We consider security research conducted in alignment with our Disclosure Policy to be protected by Safe Harbor:

  - Authorized in view of any applicable anti-hacking laws, and we will not initiate or support legal action against you for accidental, good faith violations of this policy

  - Authorized in view of relevant anti-circumvention laws, and we will not bring a claim against you for circumvention of technology controls

  - Exempt from restrictions in our Acceptable Usage Policy that would interfere with conducting security research, and we waive those restrictions on a limited basis
  
  - Lawful, helpful to the overall security of the Internet, and conducted in good faith

You are expected to comply with all applicable laws. If legal action is initiated by a third party against you and you have complied with this policy, we will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy.</p>

If at any time you have concerns or are uncertain whether your security research is consistent with this policy, please submit a report through one of our Official Channels before going any further.

<small>These are based on recommendations from [disclose.io](https://disclose.io) to accelerate adoption of vulnerability disclosure best practices.</small>
