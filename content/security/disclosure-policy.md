#### Coordinated Disclosure

**A researcher can share details of a vulnerability after a fix has been applied and our security team has provided permission to disclose.**

We will make a best effort to address and patch if possible vulnerabilities within 90 days from submission. Please keep security vulnerabilities private until we've had a chance to address them.

#### Expectations

When working with us according to this policy, you can expect us to:

- Work with you to understand and validate your report, including a timely initial response to the submission

- Work to remediate discovered vulnerabilities in a timely manner

- Recognize your contribution to improving Filecoin security if you are the first to report a unique vulnerability, and your report triggers a code or configuration change
