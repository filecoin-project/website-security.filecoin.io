A researcher can share details of a vulnerability after a fix has been applied and our security team has provided permission to disclose.

We will make a best effort to address and patch if possible vulnerabilities within 90 days from submission.

Please keep security vulnerabilities private until we've had a chance to address them.

#### Expectations

When working with us according to this policy, you can expect us to:

 - Work with you to understand and validate your report, including a timely initial response to the submission

 - Work to remediate discovered vulnerabilities in a timely manner

 - Recognize your contribution to improving Filecoin security if you are the first to report a unique vulnerability, and your report triggers a code or configuration change


#### Ground Rules

We encourage good-faith security research and ask that you follow these guidelines to avoid any confusion between legitimate research and malicious attack, we ask that you attempt, in good faith, to:

  - Testing must not violate any law or compromise any data that is not yours.
  
  - **Please refrain from the following**:
    - Denial of Service attacks and Active Exploits against the Filecoin network or Filecoin miners and nodes
    - Social engineering and phishing of Filecoin project contributors, ecosystem collaborators or community members
    - Physical or electronic attempts to access offices where project contributors work or data centers where Filecoin nodes are located
    - Compromising user accounts or stealing funds
<br/><br/>
  - Please report any vulnerability youâ€™ve discovered promptly

  - Help us improve this security process as it is critical to our mission by suggesting improvements.

  - Avoid violating the privacy of Filecoin users and community members, disrupting their systems, destroying data, stealing funds and/or harming user experience

  - Perform testing only on in-scope systems, and respect systems and activities which are out-of-scope

  - You should only interact with test accounts you own or with explicit permission from the account holder

  - If a vulnerability provides unintended access to data: Limit the amount of data you access to the minimum required for effectively demonstrating a Proof of Concept; and cease testing and submit a report immediately

  - Play by the rules. This includes following this policy any other relevant agreements

  - Use only Official Channels (emailing security@filecoin.org or Keybase chat) to discuss vulnerability information with us

  - Handle the confidentiality of details of any discovered vulnerabilities according to our Disclosure Policy
