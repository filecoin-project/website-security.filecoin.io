        Building a strong security culture in the Filecoin project has been one of our core goals from day zero of the project. It goes from creating bleeding edge, researched, and evaluated mathematical proofs that set the foundation for the critical operations executed in the Filecoin Protocol (e.g. Proof of Replication & Proof of Space Time), to building a culture of strong security habits, secure code development and testing, through working with multiple external security specialists, pentesters and researchers to audit our code and practices. Security is of utmost importance in any sound decentralized network.
      </p>
      <h5 class="entry-title">
        We invite all security researchers in joining us to maintain the security of the Filecoin Network.
